					<p>China, with Chinese civilization as its source and Chinese culture as its foundation, is one of the countries with the longest history in the world. The Chinese people of all ethnic groups have jointly created a splendid culture and have a glorious revolutionary tradition. China is a multi-ethnic country with the Han nationality as the main ethnic group. Chinese and Chinese characters are commonly used. The Han and ethnic minorities are collectively referred to as the "Chinese nation"</p>
					<p>The word "China" was first used in the inscription of "he Zun" on bronze ware in the early Western Zhou Dynasty. The words "Yu qizhai came to China and created people from it" refer to Luoyang, the center of the world at that time. At the same time, it appeared as "Huaxia", "Zhonghua", "Zhongxia", "Zhongyuan", "Zhuxia", "Zhuhua", "Shenzhou", "Jiuzhou" and "Hainei".</p>
